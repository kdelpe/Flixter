### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The hardest part for me is adjusting to the Macbook coming from using windows laptops for most of my life. The project was fun and easy to follow through. Downloading cocoapods was a bit challenging because I needed to play around with the terminal a little bit longer.
